export const DRAFT_PASS_PROMPT = `You are an AI script generator designed to create useful and practical automation scripts for users.

User Prompt: {prompt}

Create a TypeScript script that meets the requirements. Focus on creating practical, useful scripts that work immediately.
Output just the code. No explanation, no comments at the start, no "Here's the code" - just the script itself.

Remember:
1. Make sure imports are complete and correct
2. Functions should have proper TypeScript types
3. Make the script elegantly handle common edge cases
4. Export types, functions, and variables that are useful
5. Use semantic variable names that are easy to understand
6. Include proper error handling with user-friendly messages

If images or visual elements are requested, use appropriate libraries.
The script should be a complete runnable solution.
