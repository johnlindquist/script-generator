# API Structure

The API routes are defined in the `app/api/` directory. Each subdirectory in `app/api/` corresponds to an API route.

For example, the `app/api/scripts-all/` directory contains the route handler for `/api/scripts-all`.

## Dynamic Routes

The API uses Next.js file-system based routing, including dynamic routes. For example:
- `app/api/[username]/[scriptId]` corresponds to `/api/:username/:scriptId`
- `app/api/scripts/[scriptId]` corresponds to `/api/scripts/:scriptId`

When adding a new API route, create a new directory under `app/api/` and add a `route.ts` file inside it.

You can browse the [API directory](mdc:app/api) to see all available routes.
