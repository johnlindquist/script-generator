# Creating Scripts

- Create executable TypeScript scripts in a `./scripts` directory in the root of the project.
- Use a `#!/usr/bin/env bun` shebang so it can be run with `./scripts/script-name.ts`.
- Use `chmod +x` to make the script executable.

Refer to the [scripts directory](mdc:scripts) for examples.
