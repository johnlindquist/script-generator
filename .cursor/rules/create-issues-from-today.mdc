# Rule: create-issues-from-today

## Description

This rule describes the process for extracting content from today's daily note and organizing it into the correct folders in the `issues` memory project, following the conventional commit message types (e.g., fix, feature, chore, refactor, perf).

## Available Folders

- fix
- feature
- chore
- refactor
- perf

## Steps (with MCP Tools)

1. **Switch to the `issues` memory project**

   - Tool: `mcp_basic-memory_switch_project`
   - Usage: Ensure the active memory project is set to `issues` before making any changes.

2. **Locate today's daily note**

   - Tool: `mcp_basic-memory_list_directory` (to list notes)
   - Tool: `mcp_basic-memory_read_content` (to read the note)
   - Usage: Find the markdown file for today's date in the main notes or memories directory (e.g., `2025-07-16.md`).

3. **Extract actionable items**

   - (Manual step, or use AI to parse note content)
   - Usage: Read through the note and identify distinct issues, bugs, features, chores, refactors, or performance topics. For each item, determine the appropriate conventional commit type (e.g., bug = `fix`, performance = `perf`).

4. **Create or update notes in the correct folder**

   - Tool: `mcp_basic-memory_write_note`
   - Usage: For each extracted item, create a new markdown note in the corresponding folder inside the `issues` project (e.g., `fix/`, `perf/`). Use a descriptive title and include the relevant content from the daily note.

5. **Repeat for all items**

   - (Repeat steps 3–4 for each actionable item.)

6. **(Optional) Add links or references**

   - Tool: `mcp_basic-memory_write_note` (to add references/links in the note content)
   - Usage: If needed, add references back to the original daily note for traceability.

7. **Switch back to the "script-generator" project**

   - Tool: `mcp_basic-memory_switch_project`
   - Usage: Switch back to the "script-generator" project to continue working on the script.

## Example

- A bug described in the daily note becomes a file in `fix/`.
- A performance concern becomes a file in `perf/`.

This process ensures daily notes are systematically converted into actionable, categorized issues for tracking and follow-up.
