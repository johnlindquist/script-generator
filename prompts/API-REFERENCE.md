# Script Kit API Reference (Condensed)

Generated by scripts/condense-generation-assets.mjs. One summary, key bullets, and a trimmed example per API topic.

## Intro

### Welcome to Script Kit! 👋
> Script Kit provides an opinionated set of global APIs meant to streamline the process of writing scripts. Many of them (such as prompts) are meant to interact with the app, but there are also many common APIs for working with files, etc, that are simply built-in node or third-party libraries exposed as globals.

### Play with Examples in the App
> With Script Kit open, type docs and hit enter.

## Basics

### Script Imports
> Script Kit Scripts start with importing the SDK:
```ts
import '@johnlindquist/kit'
```

### Top-Level await
> All scripts are top-level await and essentially run top to bottom. Expect to see a lot of await in the scripts.
```ts
const downloadMarkdownPattern = home('Downloads', '*.md')
const files = await globby(downloadMarkdownPattern)

let totalContent = ''
for await (const file of files) {
  const content = await readFile(file, 'utf8')
  totalContent += content
}
```

### Global Helpers
> All scripts are standard node.js scripts with added helpers from the SDK. Many of the most common helpers are provided in the global scope to save you from having to import them. For example, the follow script requires no imports:
```ts
const url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnlindquist/kit-docs/refs/heads/main/API.md'
const response = await get(url)
const content = response.data
const apiPath = home('Downloads', 'API.md')
await writeFile(apiPath, content)
```

### Script Metadata
> All metadata is optional. There are two metadata modes based on your preferences:
```ts
// Name: My Amazing Script
```

### Metadata Typed Global
> Introduced in Script Kit v3, these allow a fully-typed, autocomplete experience:∫
```ts
metadata = {
  name: "My Amazing Script
}
```

### metadata
> The metadata object can include:
- name: Display name in Script Kit UI (defaults to filename)
- author: Creator's name
- description: Brief script summary
```ts
name: "Metadata Example",
  description: "This is an example of how to use metadata in a script",
  author: "John Lindquist",
};
```

## AI

### Setup
> Script Kit automatically loads AI-related environment variables from your ~/.kenv/.env file. To configure your default AI provider, model, and other options, add the following variables to your ~/.kenv/.env:
- AI_DEFAULT_PROVIDER — Default AI provider (e.g. openai, anthropic, google, xai, openrouter)
- AI_DEFAULT_MODEL — Default model for the provider (e.g. gpt-4o, claude-3-opus-20240229)
- AI_DEFAULT_TEMPERATURE — Default temperature for completions (e.g. 0.7)
```env
AI_DEFAULT_PROVIDER=anthropic
AI_DEFAULT_MODEL=claude-3-opus-20240229
AI_DEFAULT_TEMPERATURE=0.7
AI_DEFAULT_MAX_TOKENS=1000
```

### ai
> The ai helper creates a text generation function using a prompt. Use it to generate text completions based on user input or other data.
- Only improve the text.
- Do not include any other text in your response.
- Avoid using markdown formatting.
```ts
const emojiStoryGenerator = ai('Generate a story using only emoji, no text.')
const story = await emojiStoryGenerator('Epic Fantasy')
await editor(story)
```

## AI Translation

### assistant
> The assistant helper creates an AI assistant that can maintain context and handle multi-turn conversations. You can add user and system messages, and stream responses to the UI.
```ts
const downloadsPath = home('Downloads')
const files = await readdir(downloadsPath)

const jester = assistant('Tell a joke about these file names.')
jester.addUserMessage(files.join('\n'))

await editor({
  onInit: async () => {
```

## Assistant with Tools

### generate
> The generate helper allows you to generate structured data from text using a schema (such as a Zod schema). This is useful for extracting information, performing analysis, or ensuring the output matches a specific format.
```ts
const result = await generate(
  'Generate 10 random users as an array in a property called "users"',
  z.object({
    users: z.array(
      z.object({
        firstName: z.string(),
        lastName: z.string(),
        age: z.number(),
```

## Sentiment Analysis

### Switching AI Providers
> Script Kit supports multiple AI providers out of the box: openai, anthropic, google, xai, and openrouter.
- openai
- anthropic
- google
```ts
const result = await ai('Say hello', { model: 'anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229' })
```

### Provider: ${selectedProvider.name}

### Model: ${model}
> **Prompt:**

## Prompts

### arg
> Accept text input from the user.
- Accept text input from the user.
- Optionally provide a list of choices filtered by the text input.
- Optionally provide a list of actions to trigger when the user presses a shortcut.
```ts
let value = await arg()
```

### mini
> Same API as arg, but with a compact format.
```ts
let name = await mini('Enter your name')
```

### micro
> Same API as arg, but with a tiny, adorable UI.
```ts
let name = await micro('Enter your name')
```

### env
> Load an env var if it exists, prompt to set the env var if not:
```ts
// Write write "MY_ENV_VAR" to ~/.kenv/.env
let MY_ENV_VAR = await env('MY_ENV_VAR')
```

### editor
> The editor function opens a text editor with the given text. The editor is a full-featured "Monaco" editor with syntax highlighting, find/replace, and more. The editor is a great way to edit or update text to write a file. The default language is markdown.
```ts
let content = await editor()
```

### div
> div displays HTML. Pass a string of HTML to div to render it. div is commonly used in conjunction with md to render markdown.
```ts
await div(`Hello world!`)
```

### Thanks for coming to my demo
> This is a list
- This is a list
- This is another item
- This is the last item
```ts
#### div with submit links
```

### term
> The term function opens a terminal window. The terminal is a full-featured terminal, but only intended for running commands and CLI tools that require user input. term is not suitable for long-running processes (try exec instead).
```ts
await term(`cd ~/.kenv/scripts && ls`)
```

### template
> The template prompt will present the editor populated by your template. You can then tab through each variable in your template and edit it.
```ts
let text = await template(`Hello $1!`)
```

### hotkey
> The hotkey prompt allows you to press modifier keys, then submits once you've pressed a non-monodifier key. For example, press command then e to submit key info about the command and e keys:
```json
{
  "key": "e",
  "command": true,
  "shift": false,
  "option": false,
  "control": false,
  "fn": false,
  "hyper": false,
```

### drop
> Use await drop() to prompt the user to drop a file or folder.
```ts
// Dropping text or an image from the browser returns a string
let fileInfos = await drop()

let filePaths = fileInfos.map(f => f.path).join(',')

await div(md(filePaths))
```

### fields
> The fields prompt allows you to rapidly create a form with fields.
```ts
let [first, last] = await fields(['First name', 'Last name'])
```

### form
> Use an HTML form which returns an Object based on the names of the form fields.
```ts
let result = await form(`
<div class="p-4">
    <input type="text" name="textInput" placeholder="Text Input" />
    <input type="password" name="passwordInput" placeholder="Password" />
    <input type="email" name="emailInput" placeholder="Email" />
    <input type="number" name="numberInput" placeholder="Number" />
    <input type="date" name="dateInput" placeholder="Date" />
    <input type="time" name="timeInput" placeholder="Time" />
```

### chat
> A chat prompt. Use chat.addMessage() to insert messages into the chat.
```ts
await chat({
  onInit: async () => {
    chat.addMessage({
      // Note: text and position are implemented, there are other properties that are a WIP
      text: 'You like Script Kit',
      position: 'left',
    })
```

### selectFile
> Prompt the user to select a file using the Finder dialog:
```ts
let filePromptMessage = 'Select a file to upload'
let filePath = await selectFile(filePromptMessage)
let text = await readFile(filePath, 'utf8')
let gist = await createGist(text)
```

### selectFolder
> Prompt the user to select a folder using the Finder dialog:
```ts
let promptMessage = 'Select a folder for your project'
let folderPath = await selectFolder(promptMessage)

let files = await readdir(folderPath)

await editor(files.join('\n'))
```

### path
> The path prompt allows you to select a file or folder from the file system. You navigate with tab/shift+tab (or right/left arrows) and enter to select.
```ts
let selectedFile = await path()
```

### select
> select lets you choose from a list of options.
```ts
// Return an array of selected items
const multipleChoice = await select('Select one or more developer', [
  'John',
  'Nghia',
  'Mindy',
  'Joy',
])
```
